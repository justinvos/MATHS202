## Week 1
The first tutorial came as a bit of a shock. After three lectures by both Alan and Gary, various resources and hand-outs and discusion amongest the class, I felt more than ready.

However, as soon as I walked in the door, I greeted Alan and asked him where our post-graduate tutor was.

```
"Only the early morning tutorial has a post-graduate tutor."
```

I had assumed ahead of time that there was going to be an experienced, professional post-graduate tutor to lead things and we were just there to help out. As soon as I heard it was us that would be doing the leading, my heart started to race.

I tried to delay the inevitable as long as I could, but eventually I stood up with my fellow tutors and began to introduce the tutorial and ourselves to the class. Everything I said was purely off the cuff and just came flowing, but even I could hear the nerves in my voice.

On reflection, I came into the tutorial highly over-confident and under-prepared.  
I came in assuming I would be playing a minor role, but soon realised it was much more than that. I would be making class-wide annoucements, teaching new concepts and answering questions.  
It is a huge responsibility.

Now that I fully apreciate the gravity of the role as a tutor, I am going to be attempt the questions a head of time, find the possible blunders, practice the concepts and be sure of my own understanding.
