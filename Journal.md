# Maths 202 Journal

## Week 1
The first tutorial came as a bit of a shock. After three lectures by both Alan and Gary, various resources and hand-outs and discusion amongest the class, I felt more than ready.

However, as soon as I walked in the door, I greeted Alan and asked him where our post-graduate tutor was. And he then told me that *only the early morning tutorial has a post-graduate tutor.*

I had assumed ahead of time that there was going to be an experienced, professional post-graduate tutor to lead things and we were just there to help out. As soon as I heard it was us that would be doing the leading, my heart started to race.

I tried to delay the inevitable as long as I could, but eventually I stood up with my fellow tutors and began to introduce the tutorial and ourselves to the class. Everything I said was purely off the cuff and just came flowing, but even I could hear the nerves in my voice.

On reflection, I came into the tutorial highly over-confident and under-prepared.  
I came in assuming I would be playing a minor role, but soon realised it was much more than that. I would be making class-wide annoucements, teaching new concepts and answering questions.  
It is a huge responsibility.

Now that I fully apreciate the gravity of the role as a tutor, I am going to be attempt the questions a head of time, find the possible blunders, practice the concepts and be sure of my own understanding.

## Week 2
After realising a good friend of mine was both taking Maths 102 and enrolled into my designated tutorial class, under the advice of Gary, I changed my tutorial time to the Friday 9 AM class.

My new team of fellows tutors had surprisingly different views on how they were going to tackle the tutorials. While in my previous tutorial, I had taken charge and had somewhat assumed the leadership role, this new tutorial were very much go-getters themselves.

In the previous tutorial, it had an almost laid-back approach where only when a student needed help would we intervene and pull them through. However the new group were very hands-on and got involved early, even before the student requested the help.

Making this switch was not particulary challenging, however it did give me something to reflect upon. Between the two styles, I think they both have pros and cons.

Getting in the thick of it earlier does mean there is not much time wasted on the student's side, and there is less of a feeling of them being lost and confused. This means the student has more time to work on different questions and learn new things. However there is also less personal agency in this approach as the student was able to solve the problem only with the help of a tutor.

Taking a laid-back strategy does give the student this personal agency as they themselves are solving the problems and can personally feel proud of their accomplishment. On the other hand, they may get heavily bogged down in a single question, not being able to solve it. Not being able to figure out and move on from a question means the student hasn't learnt anything new or grown in their confidence in their mathematical ability.

## Week 3

This week was my personal shining moment.

Being a Computer Science major and very experienced in matrices, I had no trouble explaining difficult concepts and seeing exactly where the students and even my fellow tutors had gone wrong in their working.

Being able to share my deeper understanding and some of my personal shortcuts was very rewarding. This was especially so when I overheard one of the students passing along my techniques to another student.

Although I did not have many challenges this week, it was nice to just appreciate the rewarding aspect of teaching.
