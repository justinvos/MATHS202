# Teaching Philsophy
Justin Vos

My own teaching philsophy is centered around the development conception; where the teacher encourages the learner to be critical of the material and learn a set of skills to develop their own learning.

I enjoy when a student fully grasps a particular technique and displays the understanding by applying to a completely different problem set. This showcases that they are not only learning the content, but are learning the **"why"** and the **"how"** which is usually hidden behind the scenes.

I approach tutoring a slight bit removed and firstly try to get the student to attempt the problem themselves. If they come up against a roadblock, I review what they have achieved, where they are going wrong and also where they need to go. I then point them to a similar, simpler problem that they can solve and ask them to find the commonalities. With that hint, students begin to learn that their knowledge in Mathematics is universal and transferrable. The students are then able to connect the dots on by themselves. And as a result, the students' self confidence is boosted, they own their learning and are proud of their achievement.

In my philsophy, it is not the tutors job to show the answers, but to lead the students to find their own answers.
